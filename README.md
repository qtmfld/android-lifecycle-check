# android-lifecycle-check
A tiny minimal app for Android, with which I assured myself that

* **Activity** restarts
* **Fragment** survives

during such runtime configuration changes as:

* **screen orientation**
  * from portrait to landscape
  * landscape to portrait

* **multi-window feature**
  * single to dual
  * dual to single
  * resize in dual
