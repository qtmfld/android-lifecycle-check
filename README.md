# android-lifecycle-check
A tiny minimal app for Android, with which I assured myself that

* AppCompatActivity restarts
* Fragment survives

during runtime configuration changes, e.g.

* in screen orientation
** from portrait to landscape
** landscape to portrait
* in multi-window feature
** single to dual
** dual to single
** resize in dual
